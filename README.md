This package implements the **fast DM transform** (**FDMT**), as described in [**Zackay and Ofek (2014)**](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/11), in pure Julia. I follow the implementation as laid out in [**`pyfdmt`**][pyfdmt], written by [**Vincent Morello**][vincent], which implements the FDMT in Python using recursion. This approach is different from the pseudocode provided in the original paper, and the code in MATLAB/Python provided by the original authors, which use nested loops.

Install it by typing and running:

```bash
] add FastDedispersion
```

in the Julia REPL.


Here is an example of the DM transform, obtained via `FastDedispersion.jl`, from 30 seconds of simulated FRB data. The FRB has a DM of 1000 pc cm $^{-3}$, and an arrival time of 5 seconds, and was dedispersed from 900 to 1100 pc cm $^{-3}$. Note that the plot is zoomed-in, so that we may easily see the expected bow-tie pattern:

The simulation was carried out using the [**`simulateSearch`**](https://bitbucket.csiro.au/projects/PSRSOFT/repos/simulatesearch/browse) library. The corresponding data file, in the SIGPROC filterbank format, is included in this package as a part of its testing suite [**here**](./test/data/frb.fil).
